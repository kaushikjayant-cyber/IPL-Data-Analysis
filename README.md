PROJECT DISCRIPTION

IPL Data Analysis Project

Tools Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Description:
Conducted an in-depth analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) data to uncover meaningful insights related to player and team performance. Leveraged data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and Matplotlib for visual representation of results.

Key Highlights:

*Analyzed individual player performance metrics including total runs, strike rate, and consistency.

*Evaluated team statistics such as win ratios, highest scores, and head-to-head performance.

*Explored venue-based trends, highlighting grounds favorable for batting or bowling.

*Conducted specialized analysis on death overs, identifying the most aggressive players in the final overs.

*Determined which teams a player scored the most runs against.

*Visualized insights using plots and graphs for intuitive understanding and storytelling.

This project demonstrated strong data handling, problem-solving, and visualization skills using Pythonâ€™s data science ecosystem.
